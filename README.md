# Introduction to Arduino

This is an introductory codebase with examples of increasing complexity.
Emphasis is given on writing reusable and readable software.

## Device

The device used during the development is not always the same. 
Before using any piece of software, it should be adapted to the specific device in use.
For instance, you might find code written for the Arduino Nano, but you are using the Arduino Mega.
Device constraints, if any, should be specified in a comment at the top of the main source file.
